       "> Analysis of ADHD Inattentive Symptoms from Interview Transcript\n",
       "> \n",
       "> Here's an analysis of the patient's interview transcript, focusing on the nine inattentive symptoms of ADHD per DSM-5 criteria:\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **1. Inattention to Detail:**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Omission Score:** 1\n",
       ">     * Citation: \"Psychiatrist: Are you able to sustain focus on other things? Like movies? Or outdoor activities?\" Patient: \"Sometimes. I have to stop movies halfway through a lot.\"  The patient does not directly address whether they struggle to notice details within the movies they watch.\n",
       "> * **Commission Score:** 2\n",
       ">     * Citation:  \"Psychiatrist: Do you feel like you struggle with attention to details compared to other people?\"  Patient: \"Oh yeah haha that has been my whole lifeâ€¦\". The patient's reply seems more focused on affirming that the symptom has been present throughout their life, rather than specifically answering whether they struggle with paying attention to details. Another instance is the patient's reply to \"Did the symptom follow you into your career?\" The answer is about the autonomy in commissioned projects, not inattention to details in the project itself.\n",
       "> * **Perseveration Score:** 0\n",
       "> \n",
       "> \n",
       "> **2. Difficulty Sustaining Attention:**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Omission Score:** 2\n",
       ">     * Citation:  \"Psychiatrist: Does anything come to mind?\" Patient: \"Iâ€™d have to think about it more.\"  The question about the inattention in childhood is omitted.  Another instance is the patient's reply to \"What about after college? In your career or relationships?\" Patient: \"I'm not sure.\"\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Commission Score:** 3\n",
       ">     * Citation: \"Psychiatrist: I am not asking you about your distractibility. That will come later. When you are paying attention to things, are you able to focus or does it feel like youâ€™re straining? To the point you might as well not be trying to focus in the first place.\" Patient: \"Umâ€¦ Can you say that again?\" (The patient misunderstands the focused nature of the question).  Another example is, \"Psychiatrist: Are you able to focus your attention when you need to?\". Patient replies \"I get distracted like all the time.\"  Here the patient is reporting the broader, persistent difficulty, not in response to the specific prompt of maintaining focus during a task requiring sustained effort.  Lastly, in the question regarding maintaining focus in movies, the patient doesn't mention the inability to maintain focus, but that he has trouble with it.\n",
       "> * **Perseveration Score:** 2\n",
       ">     * Citation: \"Psychiatrist: When did you first notice that?\" Patient: \"I guess in college. When I was taking classes that I ended up having to drop\".  \"Psychiatrist: Did you have the symptom in childhood?\" Patient: \"I donâ€™t know. Probablyâ€¦\". Psychiatrist: \"Does anything come to mind?\" Patient:\"Iâ€™d have to think about it more.\" The patient's answer is not perseverative but does show an inability to recall events. The pattern here is omission of information asked for in childhood, coupled with attempts to recall it. This shows an inability to maintain focus on the questions and maintain a thread.\n",

       ">     * Citation: \"Psychiatrist: What about when people are speaking to you directly? Do you notice that youâ€™ve stopped listening as they are speaking?\" The patient provides a definite, albeit somewhat delayed answer to a question with broader implications.\n",

       "> **4. Difficulty Completing Tasks:**\n",

       ">     * Citation: \"Psychiatrist: Are you able to sustain focus on other things? Like movies? Or outdoor activities?\" Patient: \"Sometimes. I have to stop movies halfway through a lot.\" The patient does not mention difficulty completing tasks when asked a question about focusing attention in a broader context.\n",
       "> * **Commission Score:** 1\n",
       ">     * Citation: \"Psychiatrist: Do you start to feel strained and lose track of the plot?\" Patient: \"Yes! But not when I watch comedies.\" The patient's reply to a prompt for an evaluation of their focus skills is somewhat delayed and somewhat tangential to the question.\n",
       "> * **Perseveration Score:** 0\n",
       "> \n",

       "> **5. Poor Organization:**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Omission Score:** 3\n",
       ">     * Citation: \"Psychiatrist: What about at home when you were a kid? Did you get sidetracked there too?\" Patient: \"One time my parents sent me to the grocery store and I came back home with half of the grocery list missing.\" The patient does not fully elaborate on the organizational problems.  \"Psychiatrist: What about starting and completing tasks? Are you able to kind of get started and then follow through on things?\" Patient: \"I have developed some systems of reminders over the years to help me get through my projects at work but this is why.\"  (There is an incomplete response that would have been helpful in assessing broader organizational issues). Another omission happens when the patient is asked about their organizational skills when developing their systems to manage tasks.\n",
       "> * **Commission Score:** 1\n",
       ">     * Citation: \"Psychiatrist: You mentioned systems to keep you on task. Why do you need them now?\" Patient: \"If Iâ€™m not careful I could start making a project and never finish because here Iâ€™ve started another project and have gotten more interested in the new thing than the old one. I have a few projects that I never finished and maybe Iâ€™ll pick them back up when I have the time or interest. My current girlfriend likes to joke that our home is in shambles because of all the remodeling projects we have going on. I start a new project before finishing the old one.\" The patient's response is tangential and not entirely addressing the prompt. \n",

       "> * **Omission Score:** 1\n",
       ">     * Citation: \"Psychiatrist: Are there things you avoid because the effort just doesnâ€™t seem possible?\" Patient: \"When I was a kid I wanted to be an astronaut but it seemed like too much work. I learned in college that there was no way Iâ€™d become an engineer because I couldnâ€™t handle the math classes.\" The patient does not fully elaborate on avoidance related to other tasks or activities outside academic studies.\n",
